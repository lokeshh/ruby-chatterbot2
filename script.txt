Hello, what’s your name?
How are you?
Is that because you are a computer?
I like this conversation.
What kind of music you listen?
How does that make you feel?
Do you know who wins last baseball game?
I’ve seen an armadillo.
If that is true, then what?
Do you like this conversation?
How are you going to handle that?
I can not believe that is true.
Goodbye.
